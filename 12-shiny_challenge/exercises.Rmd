# Exercise

Create a new Shiny app to show a lineplot of the gapminder and a table of the data. Use the sidebar layout approach. 
Put the plot and data table in separate tabs. Make sure your app has a title.

Additionally, this app should:

1. Have a default ggplot that:
 * shows life expectancy over time, colored and grouped by country
 * facets by continent
 * whatever else you think you need to do to make the plot look nice
2. Allow the user to filter by continent
3. Allow the user to specify the year range using a slider
4. Have a data table (either using DT or a static table) that shows the data you're using
