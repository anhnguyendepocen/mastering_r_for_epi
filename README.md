# Mastering R for Epidemiologic Research

This repository contains the materials for the course Mastering R for
Epidemiologic Research.

In this workshop, we will cover the basics of reading, manipulating, and
visualizing data using an ecosystem of tools known as the Tidyverse. We
will also cover making reproducible reports with the powerful R Markdown
system. This part of the course is influenced by the [Master the
Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse) workshop
offered by RStudio but focuses more on the needs of health researchers.
We also cover modeling, Shiny, and other miscellaneous topics. The Shiny
section of the course is heavily influenced by the [full day Shiny
workshop](https://github.com/dtkaplan/shinymark) offered by RStudio.

**It is essential that you complete two tasks before we begin:**

1.  Read through the material in
    [00-intro/intro\_r.pdf](00-intro/intro_r.pdf) and complete all the
    exercises
2.  Sign up for an account at <https://rstudio.cloud>
